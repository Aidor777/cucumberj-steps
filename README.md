# cucumberj-steps
CucumberJ-Steps aims to provide ready-to-use step
definitions for Cucumber, along with extra utilities to
easily implement your own steps in JAVA.

It should help when comping up with integration tests
for some common use cases, such as making HTTP requests,
querying databases, and so on.

This is a work in progress!
